# Backend Test

Within each level directory I'll be adding :
* main.py : containing solution code, running this script will generate a json file called ```output.json```

 

Test files are grouped inside ```tests``` package at the root module.

To run the pytest we can run this command at the tests folder path :

```python -m pytest```

 (pytest must be installed in python environment in order to run the command).
